Iâ€™m a Senior Software Engineer at @Zendesk in Copenhagen where I work with the Ruby Core team on all things Ruby!

I share my personal research and discoveries here on Github and on my [blog](https://thomascountz.com). I enjoy working with web technologies, machine learning, robotics, and team/work management.

I actively share on my blog at [thomascountz.com](https://thomascountz.com) and on twitter [@thomascountz](https://thomascountz.com).
