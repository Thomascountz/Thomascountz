Iâ€™m a software engineer based in New York City. I currently work for [8thLight](https://8thlight.com) as a consultant.

My day-to-day allows me to work on a variety of teams on a variety of projects, and I share my personal research and discoveries on my [blog](https://thomascountz.com). I enjoy working with web technologies, machine learning, robotics, and team/work management.
