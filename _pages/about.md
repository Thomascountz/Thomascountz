title: About

**I'm a maker.** I love electronics, mechanics, computer programming, robotics and storytelling. My research has three purposes: to make, to learn, and to share.

I'm the co-host of [Collaborative Craft](https://8thlight.com/blog/jerome-goodrich/thomas-countz/2021/07/06/collaborative-craft-podcast.html).

My day-to-day work as a consultant at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com) allows me to work on a variety of teams on a variety of projects and it's here that I share my personal research and discoveries.
