title: About

**I'm a maker.** I love electronics, mechanics, computer programming, robotics and storytelling. My research has three purposes: to make, to learn, and to share.

My day-to-day work as a Senior Engineer on the Ruby Core team at [Zendesk](https://zendesk.com) allows me to dive deep into all things Ruby and Ruby on Rails and it's here that I share my personal research and discoveries.

I'm a former co-host of [Collaborative Craft](https://8thlight.com/blog/collaborative-craft/).
