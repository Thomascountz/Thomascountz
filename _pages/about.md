I work at Zendesk as a Senior Engineer on the Platform Core Ruby team. In my day-to-day, my team and I develop and operate one of the largest-scale ecosystems of Ruby services and gems.

Outside of my work, I enjoy exploring my interests in a wide range of topics. From programming for the web to designing and building electronics, from 3D-printing to open source data science, I share my experiments and discoveries here on my blog and on [Github](https://github.com/thomascountz).

My research has three purposes: to make, to learn, and to share.


## Some things I've done:

* Speaker
  * RailsConf 2023: [_Merged PRs: An Untapped Resource for Practice and Exploration_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLSetis6mec)
  * RailsConf 2022: [_Leveling Up from Planning to Production_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XkPMWiTRMA)
* Podcasts
  * Former co-host of the [Collaborative Craft Podcast](https://8thlight.com/blog/collaborative-craft/) (2022).
