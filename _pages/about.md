**I'm a maker.** I love electronics, mechanics, computer programming, robotics and storytelling. My research has three purposes: to make, to learn, and to share.

My day-to-day work as a Senior Engineer on the Platform Core Ruby team at [Zendesk](https://zendesk.com) allows me to dive deep into all things Ruby and Ruby on Rails and it's here that I share my personal research and discoveries.

## Some things I've done:

* Speaker
  * RailsConf 2023: [_Merged PRs: An Untapped Resource for Practice and Exploration_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLSetis6mec)
  * RailsConf 2022: [_Leveling Up from Planning to Production_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XkPMWiTRMA)
* Podcasts
  * Former co-host of the [Collaborative Craft Podcast](https://8thlight.com/blog/collaborative-craft/) (2022).
