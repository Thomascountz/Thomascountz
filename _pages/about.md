I'm a software engineer in based in New York City. I currently work for [8th Light](https://8thlight.com) as a consultant and run [The Pseudocode](https://thepseudocode.com/) newsletter.

My day to day work allows me to work on a variety of teams on a variety of project, but it's here that I share my personal research and discoveries. I work with web technologies, machine learning, and robotics.
